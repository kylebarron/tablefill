Automatically update LyX and LaTeX tables

Background
----------

I found the original idea for this code when working with [GSLab](https://github.com/gslab-econ). [The original tablefill](https://github.com/gslab-econ/gslab_python/blob/master/gslab_fill/tablefill.py) was made to automatically update LyX files with Stata or Matlab output. The workflow for the original file is as follows:
- Pre-fill tagged tables in LyX with placeholders.
- Output Stata matrices to file, with entries corresponding to placeholders.
- Run Python to update placeholders one by one with Stata output.

This project initially simply aimed to modify the script to it could fill analogous templates written in LaTeX. However, over time it added enough features that it become distinct. Several notes:
- The input tables can be generated by any program, as long as they write missing values as blank, a dot, or NA (the "." and "NA" are exceptions made for Stata and R).
- The format is to print a tag on the line prior to the table, "<tab:table_label>", and then print a tab-delimited table (typically a matrix, but it can have rows or varying length).
- For compatibility with scripts using GSLab's tablefill, the script can be run from the command line or imported as a python module.

Features
--------

- Several error and consistency checks
    - Checks inputs are correct (names and type)
    - Checks if input files exist
    - Soft warning when placeholder outside proper environment
    - Soft warning when placeholder in environment with no label
    - Soft warning when placeholder in environment with unmatched label
    - Soft warning when more placeholders than table entries
- Can fill LaTeX templates
    - There can be several placeholders in one line
    - However, there must be at most one table line per code line
    - Environment must be a table environment, not tabular
    - Placeholders can be either `#` or `\#` (note the former is a special character in LaTeX so the template will not compile if used).
    - Labels in LaTeX can be anywhere in the table environment
    - Can have several matches of the pattern in the same line
- Can be run from the command line directly or imported to a python script.
- Can choose whether to fill commented out lines.
- Adds placeholder modifiers % and ||; added placeholder type `#*#`
    - Adding the % before closing a placeholder causes tablefill to interpret it as a percentage (i.e. multiplies the number by 100).
    - Enclosing the contents of a placeholder in pipes `||`, causes tablefill to take the absolute value of the input.
    - The placeholder `#*#` causes the entry to be interpreted as a p-value. The user can specify the p-value levels and symbols to replace them with (anything that LaTeX will compile can be passed). Default is `* 0.1, **0.05, ***0.01`.
- Can compile LaTeX by passing the `--compile` and/or `--bibtex` flags.
- Added XML-based ad-hoc table combination engine.
    - The user can combine arbitrary entries of existing tables in the provided templates to create new tables. This is useful if generating new tables is costly. It is also useful to quote table statistics in a summary elsewhere in the text (the LaTeX engine can parse the placeholders as long as they are in a table environment, which can be regular text).

Setup
-----

```bash
mkdir $HOME/lib
cd $HOME/lib
git clone https://github.com/mcaceresb/tablefill
cd tablefiil
chmod +x ./tablefill.py
./tablefill.py --help
```

This was created specifically to run in a server that only had Python 2.6 available. The function should be compatible with Python 2.6, Python 2.7, and Python 3.X without requiring the installation of any additional packages.

Documentation
-------------

### Main function

### XML combination engine

TODO
----

- [ ] Finish writing the documentation for the project.
- [ ] Document XML combination engine. Provide option to ignore.
- [ ] Add option to have the XML file be a separate file.
- [ ] Update unit testing (tests are mostly copy/paste from the original tablefill).

The original tablefill is part of [GSLab's python tools](https://github.com/gslab-econ/gslab_python) under the [MIT license](https://github.com/gslab-econ/gslab_python/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). Though this code base shares little in common with the original script, it is based on their original idea and should be able to run anything using their original code with no modification.
