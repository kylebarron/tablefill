# Automatically update LyX and LaTeX tables

I received some Python code whose purpose was to to automatically update
LyX files with Stata output. The mechanism
- Pre-fill tagged tables in LyX with placeholders
- Output Stata matrices to file, with entries corresponding to placeholders
- Run Python to update placeholders one by one with Stata output

This tablefill.py
- Adds several error and consistency checks
    - Checks input names and types
    - Checks whether input files exist
    - Soft warning when placeholder outside proper environment
    - Soft warning when placeholder in environment with no label
    - Soft warning when placeholder in environment with unmatched label
- Implements the same idea for LaTeX
    - There can be several placeholders in one line
    - However, there must be at most one table line per code line
    - Environment must be a table environment, not tabular
    - Placeholders can be either # or \#
- Can be run from the command line directly or imported to a make.py

For details see tablefill_help.txt or the docstrings in tablefill.py
